## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a Mechanical Engineer currently completing a dual Masterâ€™s degree in Advanced Energy Technologies at UC Berkeley and the Polytechnic University of Madrid. My work sits at the intersection of thermal systems, CFD, and product designâ€”where precision meets innovation.

I have a wide and strong educational background that balances very well with my hads-on experience especifically in thermal modelling, CFD, CAD, manufacturing and prototyping. 

Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex thermal and energy problems. Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities where I can contribute to cutting-edge thermal design and help bring innovative hardware to life.
## ðŸ“„ Tritium Extraction using Compact Heat Exchangers (Capstone Project)
Tritium is a fuel source for nuclear fusion power plants. Manufacturing tritium is highly expensive, so modern fusion energy devices utilize molten salt to produce it. Using computational fluid dynamics software, our team is analyzing various heat exchanger designs to determine a cost-effective method of tritium extraction from the molten salt. Optimizing tritium extraction would greatly increase fuel cycle sustainability and the viability of commercial fusion energy.

## ðŸ“„ Tritium Extraction using Compact Heat Exchangers (Capstone Project)

> **Fusion power promises a clean, nearly limitless energy sourceâ€”but the tritium fuel cycle is a critical challenge.**

Tritium is a key fuel for nuclear fusion. Since it is scarce and expensive to produce, modern fusion energy concepts often rely on **molten salt coolants** to breed tritium within the reactor blanket. Our capstone project investigates a method for extracting tritium from this molten salt using **compact heat exchangers**.

Using **CFD simulations**, our team is evaluating and comparing various heat exchanger geometries to identify a **cost-effective**, **efficient**, and **scalable** tritium extraction system. Our findings could significantly improve the sustainability of fusion fuel cyclesâ€”bringing fusion energy one step closer to commercial viability.
