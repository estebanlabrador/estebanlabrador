## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a Mechanical Engineer currently completing a dual Masterâ€™s degree in Advanced Energy Technologies at UC Berkeley and the Polytechnic University of Madrid. My work sits at the intersection of thermal systems, CFD, and product designâ€”where precision meets innovation.

I specialize in thermal modeling, simulation, and hardware prototyping, with hands-on experience in optimizing refrigeration systems for data centers and developing comfort-driven thermal models for wearable devices.

Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex thermal and energy problems in emerging technologies like AR/VR, wearables, and sustainable computing. Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities where I can contribute to cutting-edge thermal design and help bring innovative hardware to life.
