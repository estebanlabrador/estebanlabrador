## ⚛️ Tritium Extraction using Compact Heat Exchangers 

> **Fusion power promises a clean, nearly limitless energy source—but the tritium fuel cycle is a critical challenge.**

Tritium is a key fuel for nuclear fusion. Since it is scarce and expensive to produce, modern fusion energy concepts often rely on **molten salt coolants** to breed tritium within the reactor blanket. Our capstone project investigates a method for extracting tritium from this molten salt using **compact heat exchangers**.

Using **CFD simulations**, our team is evaluating and comparing various heat exchanger geometries to identify a **cost-effective**, **efficient**, and **scalable** tritium extraction system. Our findings could significantly improve the sustainability of fusion fuel cycles—bringing fusion energy one step closer to commercial viability.

## ❄️ Cascade Refrigeration with NH₃ and CO₂ 

> **How can we improve refrigeration efficiency using environmentally friendly refrigerants?**

This project models a **cascade vapor-compression refrigeration system** using ammonia (NH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂)—two natural refrigerants with low global warming potential. I conducted a **parametric study** to evaluate how system performance changes with **intermediate temperature**, **subcooling**, and **ambient conditions**.

## 🛠️ Compressed Air Engine 
> **Can we build a fully operational engine from scratch using compressed air and innovative design?**

Inspired by INNengine’s opposed-piston architecture, this project set out to **design**, **manufacture**, and **test** a **4-cylinder compressed air engine**. Our team successfully delivered a functional prototype through rigorous mechanical design, hands-on fabrication, and iterative problem-solving, after several years of failed attempts in past cohorts.

This project reflects my experience in **mechanical systems design**, **manufacturing**, **instrumentation**, and **practical prototyping**—delivering results where many attempts had previously failed.

## 🔥 Reactive Transport Modeling in Combustion Systems

> **Understanding and controlling combustion is essential for advancing clean energy and propulsion technologies.**

In this research collaboration, I worked on numerically modeling **1D reactive transport phenomena** including **diffusion**, **convection**, and **reaction** using various **time integration schemes**. Through simulations of systems like the **Brusselator**, **Van der Pol oscillator**, and **hydrogen flame dynamics**, we investigated the **stability, accuracy, and performance** of **explicit**, **implicit**, and **Chebyshev-based Runge-Kutta (RKC)** schemes.

This work built a robust numerical foundation for studying **combustion fronts**, **detonation phenomena**, and **reactive eigenvalue stability**—key tools for energy system optimization and flame control.

## ⚡ Hydrogen Fuel Cell Modeling

> **Understanding hydrogen fuel cells’ internal behavior is essential for improving efficiency and advancing the clean energy transition.**

I developed a **1D MATLAB simulation** of a **Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC)** that models the transport of gases, heat, and electric charge across its seven-layer structure. The model involves a **highly nonlinear system** that is complex to solve, enabling analysis of how design choices and operating conditions influence fuel cell efficiency.

This project showcases my skills in **numerical modeling**, **energy systems**, and **hydrogen technology**, and contributes to a deeper understanding of how to optimize fuel cells for real-world energy applications.
