## 📄 Tritium Extraction using Compact Heat Exchangers (Capstone Project)

> **Fusion power promises a clean, nearly limitless energy source—but the tritium fuel cycle is a critical challenge.**

Tritium is a key fuel for nuclear fusion. Since it is scarce and expensive to produce, modern fusion energy concepts often rely on **molten salt coolants** to breed tritium within the reactor blanket. Our capstone project investigates a method for extracting tritium from this molten salt using **compact heat exchangers**.

Using **CFD simulations**, our team is evaluating and comparing various heat exchanger geometries to identify a **cost-effective**, **efficient**, and **scalable** tritium extraction system. Our findings could significantly improve the sustainability of fusion fuel cycles—bringing fusion energy one step closer to commercial viability.

## ❄️ Cascade Refrigeration with NH₃ and CO₂ (Thermodynamics Project)

> **How can we improve refrigeration efficiency using environmentally friendly refrigerants?**

This project models a **cascade vapor-compression refrigeration system** using ammonia (NH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂)—two natural refrigerants with low global warming potential. We conducted a **parametric study** to evaluate how system performance changes with **intermediate temperature**, **subcooling**, and **ambient conditions**.

We first simulated a simple NH₃ cycle with an evaporation temperature of -35ºC and a condensation temperature of 50ºC, resulting in a COP of 1.79. Under the same conditions, the **cascade system achieved a COP of 1.829**, showing a measurable improvement.

Through MATLAB-based modeling, we observed that:
- **Lower intermediate temperatures** increase COP and reduce NH₃ mass flow due to its superior thermodynamic properties.
- **Subcooling** improves performance by reducing NH₃ mass flow and increasing COP.
- **Colder ambient temperatures** and **warmer refrigerated spaces** both improve overall efficiency.

Our findings offer insights into designing **efficient**, **eco-friendly**, and **real-world applicable** refrigeration systems.
